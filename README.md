# Customer Churn Prediction using TensorFlow

This repository contains a simple machine learning project that predicts whether a customer will churn using TensorFlow. It's intended for educational and demonstration purposes.

## Overview

- **Problem Type**: Binary Classification  
- **Framework**: TensorFlow (Keras API)  
- **Goal**: Predict if a customer will leave the service (churn) based on their attributes.

## Results

The model outputs accuracy and loss metrics. You can modify the code to include precision, recall, and confusion matrix for a more detailed evaluation.
